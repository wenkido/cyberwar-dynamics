Through the project me and my teammate were intended to prove the causality between significant political events, which are directly or indirectly related to the United States and Russian Federation, and cyber attacks imposed on these countries. To prove the hypothesis, we have operated with the cybercrime database retrieved from the Council on Foreign Relations. In this database, we operated with the columns 'Date' and 'Victims'. Cybercrime dynamics were examined by comparing the occurrence of attacks before and after a particular political event, and supported by difference-in-differences method. We have also created plots for each political event of our choice using Matplotlib to visualize the difference. As a result, we proved the interdependence between international politics and the number of cyber attacks on the countries of our interest.
